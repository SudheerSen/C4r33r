## 3. How does a website work step by step?
  ### Brief:
    Step 1 - Request.
    Step 2 - Server Response.
    Step 3 - HTML generation.
    Step 4 - CSS and JavaScript.
    Step 5 - Brower Rendering.
    Step 6 - User Interaction.

 ### Explain:
 ##### Request: 
    When a user enters a URL into their web browser, A request is sent to the server where the website is hosted.
     
 ##### Server response: 
      The server receives the request and processes it, typically by using a server-side scripting language, 
      such as PHP or Ruby on Rails, to generate the content for the website.
      
 ##### HTML generation: 
      The server generates the HTML code for the website, which defines the structure and content of the page.
      
##### CSS and JavaScript: 
      The server may also generate and send CSS and JavaScript files that are used to style and add interactivity to the website.     

##### Browser rendering:
    The web browser receives the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from the server and uses them to render the website and display it to the user.
  
##### User interaction: 
      The user can interact with the website by clicking links, filling out forms, or performing other actions.
      

   This is a simplified explanation of how a website works, and the actual process can be much more complex, depending on the size
      This overview should give you a general idea of the steps involved in serving a website to a user.
      
      
      
## 4. What are the 3 types of websites?
	Static website
  	Dynamic website
  	Hybrid website
	
	
	Static website:
  		A static website is a simple type of website that is made up of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are stored on a server. 
		The content of a static website does not change dynamically and is the same for all users. 
		Static websites are often used for personal or small business websites that do not require dynamic content or user interaction. 


	Dynamic website:
  		A dynamic website is a type of website that generates its content dynamically in response to user actions or other events. 
		Dynamic websites are built using server-side scripting languages, such as PHP or Ruby on Rails, and typically involve a database to store and retrieve data.
		Dynamic websites are often used for e-commerce, social networking, or other types of websites that require dynamic content and user interaction.
    	
	
	Hybrid website:
 		A hybrid website is a type of website that combines elements of both static and dynamic websites. A hybrid website may have some static content and some 	
		dynamic content, and may use a combination of server-side scripting and client-side scripting (such as JavaScript) to generate its content. 
		Hybrid websites are often used for complex websites that require a mix of static and dynamic content and user interaction.
	
   These are three of the most common types of websites, but there are many other types of websites as well, including informational websites, portfolio websites, blogs, and forums. The type of website that is best for a particular purpose depends on the requirements of the website and the goals of the website owner.
