1. Owasp Top 10
    The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.
	-Broken Access Control
	-Cryptographic Failures
	-Injection
	-Insecure Design
	-Security Misconfiguration
	-Vulnerable and outdated Components
	-identification and Authentication Failures
	-Security Logging and Monitoring 
	-SSRF

2.Social Engineering
   Malicious activities acomplished trhough human interactions.
   Phychological manupulation to get senstive information
 Three Types of SE
 -Human Based
 	-Shouldier Surfing
	-Vishing
	-Evasedropping 
-Computer Based
	-Email phishing 
	-Pop up
-Mobile Based
	-Message Phishing 
	-Spam messaging
	-SMS phishing 
	
	
3. How does a website work step by step?
    Step 1 - URL Gets Resolved.
    Step 2 - Request Is Sent.
    Step 3 - Response Is Parsed.
    Step 4 - Page Is Displayed.
    Server-side.
    Browser-side.

4. What are the 3 types of websites?
   -Static website design- ...
   -CMS or dynamic website- ...
   -eCommerce website-

5. How are websites hacked?
	social engineering/ phishing emails, and links, etc.
	Hackers usually use brute-force attacks
	Guessing usernames and passwords, trying generic passwords, 
	using password generator tools, 

6. 10 tips for secure a website
	SSL Configuration
	Encrypt data
	Stop sql Injection
	Remove embeded sql
	Secure credential
	Enforce complex passwod
	Secure API
	Vulnerability patching 
	DDOS Protection
	PCI Compliance
	Check Version 


7. What is Metasploit used for?
	It allows testers to scan systems for vulnerabilities,
	 conduct network reconnaissance, 
	 Exploit modules—allow testers to target a specific, known vulnerability. 
	 Metasploit has a large number of exploit modules, 
	 including buffer overflow and SQL injection exploits.


8. What is malware with example?
Ans-: Malware is a type of software that is designed to cause harm to a computer system or network. There are several types of malware, including:
	1.Virus: A program that infects other software and replicates itself.

	2.Worm: A type of virus that spreads itself over a network without the need for a host file.

	3.Trojan: A type of malware that disguises itself as a legitimate program and is used to gain unauthorized access to a system.

	4.Ransomware: Malware that encrypts the victim's files and demands a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key.

	5.Adware: Software that displays unwanted ads and pop-ups.

	6.Spyware: Software that tracks a user's behavior and activity without their knowledge.

	7.Rootkit: A type of malware that hides itself and its malicious activity from detection.

	8.Banking Trojan: A type of malware that is specifically designed to steal sensitive financial information, such as login credentials and credit card numbers.

	9.RAT: Remote access trojans (RATs) are malware designed to allow an attacker to remotely control an infected computer. Once the RAT is running on a compromised system, the attacker can send commands to it and receive data back in response.
	
	It is important to regularly update your computer's security software and to be cautious when downloading and installing new software to reduce the risk of infection by malware.

	
	

9. VPN stands for "virtual private network" — a service that helps you stay private online. A VPN establishes a secure, encrypted connection between your computer and the internet, providing a private tunnel for your data and communications while you use public networks

10.Proxy-: A proxy server is a system or router that provides a gateway between users and the internet.

11. what is 3 way handshake
	A three-way handshake is also known as a TCP handshake or SYN-SYN-ACK, and requires both the client and server to exchange SYN (synchronization) and ACK (acknowledgment) packets before actual data communication begins


12. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a client

13. TCP-UDP
	TCP:- Connection-oriented protocol,
		-TCP Slower
		-Retransmission of lost data packets is only possible with TCP
	UDP:- Connectionless protocol. 
		-UDP is much faster
		
		
14. Client-Side Attack:-
	Broken Client-side Access Control.
	DOM-based XSS.
	Sensitive Data Leakage.
	Vulnerable and Outdated Components. 
	Lack of Third-party Origin Control.
	JavaScript Drift.
	Sensitive Data Stored Client-Side.
	Client-side Security Logging and Monitoring Failures.		

15. Server-Side Attacks:-
	DOS attack
	Website Defacement
	Directory Traversal
	Misconfiguration attacks
	Phishing Attack
	Information Gathering
	Vulnerability Scanning
	Password Attacks
